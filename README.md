# RFCML Furnace Upgrade - TMS Meter Cubed Furnace Testing Data Processing
This repository contains software and utilities used for processing data from testing the TIC Module being developed as part of the instrumentation and control electronics upgrade project for RFCML Casting Furnace at the University of Arizona.

Data is obtained from the Meter Cubed Furnace Test.

## Usage
1. Extract data from original files
Run 'extract_data.m' to extract data from the source files from both the Legacy Furnace Control System and the Furnace Upgrade System, raw data is stored in FITS files by the legacy system and CSV files by the upgrade system.

2. Process data
Run 'preprocess_data.m' to apply several pre-processing operations to the raw data, mostly related to cleaning up the data and selecting a subset of the data to work with. Either run the whole script or sections of the code.

This scrip relies on the CSV files generated by 'extract_data.m', once those files are on disk there is no need to run that script again, unless new data becomes available.
